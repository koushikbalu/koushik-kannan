Welcome to my project, 
This project is all about the game which we all play in our childhood and its none other than TIC-TAC-TOE. Surely all of us would have come across this game during some part of our childhood days. 
Here I have designed this game using very simple and frequently used c language statements like if-else, do-while and some other commonly used functions. Hope you all enjoy playing this game.
Thank you.
